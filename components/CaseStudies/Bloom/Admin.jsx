        We knew Bloom had to work just as well for the church team as it did for
        members. So, we built a dashboard that feels like second nature. Pastors
        can add devotionals, share events, and check which sermons are
        resonating. All without needing a tech manual. Itâ€™s their quiet
        backstage, keeping the app fresh and the whole community feeling cared
        for.
